# Solo

The single-juror form of `/evaluate`: one subagent, one ranked verdict. The
convener chooses the counts; standalone, that is all nine from `SKILL.md` §2.

The measured fact still holds: findings come from reading each count on its
own, not from a general look. A solo juror pays for that by **sequence** — it
tries the counts one at a time, closes each before opening the next, and
writes each count's return before moving on, so a later count cannot quietly
absorb an earlier one.

## Brief for the subagent

Give the juror the dossier path (assembled exactly as `SKILL.md` §1), the
selected counts in order, any narrowing of `proof` the convener allows, and
this:

> Read `CHARGES.md` beside this file in full. Try the target under each
> selected count **in the supplied order**, one at a time, and write that
> count's return — findings or *nothing to charge* — before starting the next.
> Every finding takes the shape *What every juror owes* prescribes.
>
> Return one document: findings ranked `blocking`, `to fix`, `noted`; then
> the frozen target (head SHA or merge-base); then the counts that returned
> nothing to charge, named one by one.

## What the convener does with it

The same deliberation as `SKILL.md` §3, minus the merge of overlaps — one
juror already saw them together.

A verdict with no `blocking` and no `to fix` is **go**. Anything else goes
back to whoever writes code, entry by entry.
